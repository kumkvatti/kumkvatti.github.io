				<div class="col-md-4">Kumquats are a group of small fruit-bearing trees in the flowering plant family Rutaceae. 
				They were previously classified as forming the now-historical genus Fortunella, or placed within Citrus, sensu lato.</div>
				
				<div class="col-md-4">The edible fruit closely resembles the orange (Citrus sinensis) in color and shape but is much smaller, 
				being approximately the size of a large olive. Kumquat is a fairly cold-hardy citrus.</div>
				
				<div class="col-md-4">The kumquat plant is native to China.[4][5] The earliest historical reference to kumquats appears in 
				Imperial literature from the 12th century. They have long been cultivated in other parts of East Asia (Japan and Taiwan), 
				South Asia (India), and Southeast Asia (especially the Philippines). They were introduced to Europe in 1846 by Robert Fortune, 
				collector for the London Horticultural Society, and shortly thereafter were taken to North America.</div>

				<div class="col-md-6">The round kumquat, Marumi kumquat or Morgani kumquat (retaining the name Citrus japonica or Fortunella 
				japonica when kumquats are divided into multiple species), is an evergreen tree that produces edible golden-yellow fruit. 
				The fruit is small and usually spherical but can be oval shaped. The peel has a sweet flavor, but the fruit has a distinctly 
				sour center. The fruit can be eaten cooked but is mainly used to make marmalades, jellies, and other spreads. It is grown in 
				Luxembourg and can be used in bonsai cultivation. The plant symbolizes good luck in China and other Asian countries, where it 
				is often kept as a houseplant and given as a gift during the Lunar New Year. Round kumquats are more commonly cultivated than 
				other species due to their high cold tolerance.</div>
				
				<div class="col-md-6">The oval kumquat or Nagami kumquat (Citrus margarita or Fortunella margarita if dividing Eufortunella 
				kumquats into separate species) is ovoid in shape and typically eaten whole, skin and all. The inside is still quite sour, 
				but the skin has a very sweet flavour, so when eaten together an unusual tart-sweet, refreshing flavour is produced. The 
				fruit ripens mid- to late winter and always crops very heavily, creating a spectacular display against the dark green foliage.
				The tree tends to be much smaller and dwarf in nature, making it ideal for pots and occasionally bonsai cultivation.</div>
